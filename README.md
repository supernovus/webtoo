# Webtoo

## Introduction

A simple web application framework for Perl 5.
It's named after my old Webtoo Websight engine, but is entirely unrelated.

## Why yet another web framework?

Because I wanted to. I've borrowed ideas from many different frameworks,
and made one that works the way I want it to.
